# exometer_rrets

Simple `rrets` based reporter for exometer.

## Synopsis

[Exometer](https://github.com/Feuerlabs/exometer) is an Erlang metrics aggregator from Feuerlabs. 
It's a perfect tool for a realtime metrics collection and simple statistical analysis. 

It's builtin reporters allowing one to export metrics to graphite or statsd. What I was missing
was a simple persistence layer allowing me to follow and store the changes without relying on 
external tools.
